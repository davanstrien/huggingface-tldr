## Extension Settings

If there is sufficient interest in this plugin I will upload it to the Chrome Web Store. For now, you can use the extension by following the installation instructions above.

To access the extension settings:

1. Right-click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2. Select "Options" from the context menu.
3. In the settings page, enter your Hugging Face token in the provided input field.

Note: The token is securely stored in the extension's local storage and is only used for authenticating requests to the Hugging Face API when submitting votes. You only need to provide a read-only token, as the extension does not require write access to your Hugging Face account.
